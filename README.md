# Semantic HTML Homework

## Objectives
In this homework activity my goal was to refactor a website by introducing semantic HTML elements and increase accessibility to make it more search engine friendly. I made the CSS more efficient by combining classes that had the same function into one class and organized the code to follow the same structure as the html file. I added comments to make it clear where everything is in the code.
